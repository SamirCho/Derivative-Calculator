    <h1>Derivative Calculator</h1>
    <h2>Calculating derivative with respect to x; other variables are considered as constants.</h2>
    <h2>Input field should be an algebriac expression in standard form, such as, Ax^2 + Bx + C. Negative exponents are also supported and should be written as Ax^-B, where A is a coefficient and B is part of the exponent of the variable. Rational expressions should be written as negative exponents and fractions should be converted to decimals.</h2>
    <h2>Select a function that will be applied to the entered expression, or press "no function" to evaluate just the expression itself.</h2>
    <h2>Trigonometric functions are assumed to be radians.</h2>
    <h2>Customize the base of logarithmic and exponential functions here: <input id="base" class="field" value="10"> They are set as 10 by default. The natural logarithm and exponential functions are also available.</h2>
    <h2>Due to the way binary floating-point numbers store decimal values, decimals must be rounded. To be as accurate as possible indicate how many decimals you intend on using here: <input id="dec" class="field" value="0"> You do not need to worry about this (leave as 0) if you are using only integers.</h2>
