    <h1>Derivative Calculator</h1>
    <h2>Calculating derivative with respect to x; other variables are considered as constants.</h2>
    <h2>Input field should be an algebriac expression in standard form, such as, Ax^2 + Bx + C. Negative exponents should be written as Ax^-B, where A is a coefficient and B is part of the exponent of the variable.</h2>
    <h2>Select a function that will be applied to the entered expression, or press "no function" to evaluate just the expression itself.</h2>
    <h2>Trigonometric functions are assumed to be radians.</h2>
    <h2>The last two buttons allow you to customize the base of logarithmic and exponential functions. They are set as 2 by default. The natural logarithm and exponential functions also available.</h2>
