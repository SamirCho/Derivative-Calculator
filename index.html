    <h1>Derivative Calculator</h1>
    <h2>Calculating derivative with respect to x; other variables are considered as constants.</h2>
    <h2>Input field should be an algebriac expression in standard form, such as, Ax^2 + Bx + C. Negative exponents are also supported and should be written as Ax^-B, where A is a coefficient and B is part of the exponent of the variable. Rational expressions should be written as negative exponents and fractions should be converted to decimals.</h2>
    <h2>Select a function that will be applied to the entered expression, or press "no function" to evaluate just the expression itself.</h2>
    <h2>Trigonometric functions are assumed to be in radians.</h2>
    <h2>Customize the base of logarithmic and exponential functions here: <input id="base" class="field" value="10"> They are set as 10 by default. The natural logarithm and exponential functions are also available.</h2>
    <h2>Customize the power you raise your function to in the "nth power" button here: <input id="npower" class="field" value="2"> Set as 2 by default.</h2>
